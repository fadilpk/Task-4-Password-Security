# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

**Intern Name:** Mohammed Fadil PK
**Date:** January 20, 2026

## 📄 Project Description
This repository contains the analysis for **Task 4**, focusing on password hashing and cracking. I demonstrated how weak passwords (MD5) can be reversed using rainbow table attacks and discussed the importance of MFA.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1.  **Hash Generation:** Converted the password `melvin123` into an MD5 hash.
2.  **Hash Cracking:** Successfully recovered the plain-text password using an online lookup tool.
3.  **Security Analysis:** Evaluated why MD5 is obsolete and why Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is critical.

## 📂 Files Included
* `Task4_Password_Analysis.pdf` - The full report with screenshots of the attack.
